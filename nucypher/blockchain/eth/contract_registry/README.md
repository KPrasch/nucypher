## Historical deployments

The following is a list of networks that we used at some point in the past and that are currently deprecated:

* `miranda`: Our first decentralized testnet.
* `frances`: Our second testnet. Only for development purposes.
* `cassandra`: Incentivized Testnet, supporting our 'Come and Stake It' initiative.
* `gemini`: New version of Incentivized Testnet, supporting Phase 4 of 'Come and Stake It'.
* `ibex`: Public testnet, intended as a playground for stakers & node operators (e.g., learning how to create and manage stakes, setting up a node), as well as for internal development purposes. Running on Ethereun Rinkeby testnet.
* `oryx`: Staking testnet on Ropsten for initial threshold network integration
