Resolve function_abi AFTER condition is initialized 

Problem
- when specifying a `standard_contract_type`, the `function_abi` is resolved
  immediately
- when this condition is serialized, it contains both `standard_contract_type`
  and `function_abi`, which we are trying to prevent

Solution
- call `_resolve_abi` after the condition is initialized
